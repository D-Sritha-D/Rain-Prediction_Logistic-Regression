# Rain-Prediction_Logistic-Regression
In this project, we will be using the Rain in Australia Dataset which contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations. We are tasked with creating a fully automated system that can use today's weather data for a given location to predict whether it will rain at the location tomorrow.
